        <p> >>>>>>>>>Early 1993: Dave raggett begins to write his own browser</p>
        <p> While Eric Bina and the NCSA Mosaic gang were hard at it hacking through the night , Dave Raggett of
            Hewlett-Packard labs in bristol was working part-time on his Arena browser , on which he hoped to
            demonstrate all sorts of newly invented featuress for HTML</p>

    <h1>Evolution of HTML</h1>
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;"> 1. HTML 1.0:</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="mbp-1"> <strong>1. HTML 1.0:</strong> The first version of HTML was released in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee,
        the inventor of the
        World Wide Web. HTML 1.0 had a limited set of elements and features, primarily focused on structuring text-based
        documents with basic formatting.</div>
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">2. HTML 2.0:</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="mbp-1">2. HTML 2.0: In 1995, HTML 2.0 was published as a significant update. It introduced new features
        like tables,
        images, and form elements, allowing for more complex layouts and interactivity on web pages.</p>
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">3. HTML 3.2:</h2>
    </div>



    HTML 3.2: HTML 3.2 was released in 1997 and introduced additional features such as support for cascading style
    sheets (CSS), which allowed for better control over the presentation of web pages. It also included new elements
    like frames and image maps.
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">4. HTML 4.01:</h2>
    </div>
    HTML 4.01: HTML 4.01 was published in 1999 and became widely adopted. It brought further improvements to layout
    control and added new elements and attributes. HTML 4.01 also introduced support for scripting languages like
    JavaScript, enabling more dynamic and interactive web content.
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">5. XHTML:</h2>
    </div>
    XHTML: In 2000, the XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) standard was introduced. XHTML combined the syntax
    and rules of XML with HTML, creating a stricter and more well-formed version of HTML. XHTML aimed to ensure
    compatibility with future XML-based technologies.
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">6. HTML5:</h2>
    </div>
    HTML5: HTML5, the fifth major revision of HTML, was released in 2014. It introduced numerous new features and
    improvements, including native support for audio and video playback, canvas for drawing graphics, semantic elements
    for better document structure, and enhanced form controls. HTML5 also marked a shift towards more standardized and
    consistent web development practices.
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">7. HTML 5.1,5.2,5.3:</h2>
    </div>
    HTML5.1, HTML5.2, and HTML5.3: After the initial release of HTML5, subsequent versions like HTML5.1, HTML5.2, and
    HTML5.3 were introduced with incremental updates and refinements to the specification. These versions focused on
    enhancing existing features, improving accessibility, and addressing compatibility issues.
    <div class="bg-1">
        <h2 style="background-color: black; margin: 5px;">8. HTML Living Standard </h2>
    </div>
    HTML Living Standard: Instead of following a versioned release approach, the HTML specification is now maintained as
    a "Living Standard." It continues to evolve and be updated based on community input and advancements in web
    technologies. The HTML Living Standard ensures backward compatibility and provides guidance for developers to create
    modern web applications.
